					<h1>Work</h1>

					<p>Below are three poems from my manuscript, based on the life of Gilbert White, entitled In Defense of the Fern-owl.</p>

					<article>
					<h2>In Which I Play Animal Vegetable Mineral with Uncle</h2>

					<p>Uncle wrote
					several intelligent people believe<br>
					star-sluch is frogs thrown up indigested<br>
					pray Molly<br>
					hunt for star-sluch<br>
					the daughter of Charles, he wrote<br>
					elder brother of the Reverend Andrew Etty here now<br>
					stares and wonders when I say it is vegetable<br>
					and Dr Chandler shakes his head<br>
					something about eating frogs about to reproduce<br>
					something about the egg-gelly swelling<br>
					in the craws of crows and herons<br>
					I beg of them to know why crows are not sometimes crop-sick<br>
					why they have not weak digestions in Hants as well as in Cheshire<br>
					we may just as well side with the old ones<br>
					and declare the trembling gelly<br>
					to be the excrement of stars<br>
					or the form stars take once fallen<br>
					uncle was glad of my reply<br>
					and to hear I met with the Star-sluch in Cheshire<br>
					so soon after examining the Tremella Nostoc in Hants<br>
					not that he’d had any doubt, he insisted<br>
					that the former was a vegetable<br>
					but intelligent people are still persuaded he lamented<br>
					this substance is a mass of indigested food<br>
					cast-up out of the stomachs of crows<br>
					they tell me so face to face<br>
					they say they have distinguished the limbs of frogs among it<br>
					and further their argument by telling me<br>
					the matter was found on the bough of an oak<br>
					one must not forget the seeds of all Fungi<br>
					are lighter than air (he made a line under all Fungi)<br>
					and therefore float about in it; and vegetate<br>
					when they happen to fall on a proper nest<br>
					pray Molly he wrote<br>
					apply a magnifying glass<br>
					to the substance and try to discover seeds<br>
					</p>

					<h2>The Duke of Richmond's Moose</h2>
					<p>Michaelmas 1768<br>
					Foreign animals seldom fall in my way;<br>
					my little intelligence is confined to the narrow sphere<br>
					of my own observations at home.<br>
					at that time the wasps were thinning<br>
					and the hop-picking was nearly over<br>
					hedgehogs were boring into the grasswalks to eat the plantain roots<br>
					this was the year when nectarines rotted on the trees<br>
					the same morning I heard of the moose-deer<br>
					I remember rooks playing by pairs in the air over the church mead<br>
					and three black warty water-efts with fin tails and yellow bellies<br>
					were drawn up in our well-bucket<br>
					the moose had died the morning before<br>
					and was being kept in an old greenhouse<br>
					slung under the belly and chin by ropes<br>
					so to be in a standing position<br>
					long legs—short neck<br>
					ears vast and loping<br>
					as long as the neck<br>
					with a head like an ass<br>
					its lips were excessive<br>
					(a delicacy I am told)<br>
					its nostrils huge<br>
					I could not take measurements<br>
					could not examine the teeth<br>
					tongue, lips, hoofs etc. minutely<br>
					it was in so putrid a state<br>
					the stench was hardly supportable<br>
					and i had to stay clear of it<br>
					</p>

					<h2>Outrage on Michaelmas</h2>
					<p>Here I hang-<br>
					specimen, oddity<br>
					limp and heavy in every direction<br>
					my four hoofs grazed by English grass<br>
					the pandemonious wilderness was my home<br>
					everything standing except that which had fallen<br>
					everything undone but that which held<br>
					I would have raged with a mightier effort<br>
					crossed all the rivers and the lakes too<br>
					crashed a million miles uphill<br>
					to escape this rotting in a sling<br>
					may my putrification<br>
					drive you clear off the world<br>
					I am for the moose-territories<br>
					the eternal bogs of Canada<br>
					my guardian pond-angels accompany me<br>
					with their blossomy upturned eyes and I am attached<br>
					by their magenta-twinged stems<br>
					to the bottom-muck of home<br>
					forgive me O squeamish beholder<br>
					if I begin to reek while your story plays out</p><br>
